# Blog-Team-Beans
Little blog that I built in a team of three. Including Java (Spring Boot) backend, View (Thymeleaf), database (MariaDB) 

The task was to build a little blog that would cover the following user stories:
1. a user can see all posts in the blog, ordered by time descendingly (newest post first)
2. a user can see comments on a post, ordered by time ascendingly (oldest comment first)
3. an anonymous user can create an account with a user name and password 
4. an anonymous user can login using their user name and password 
5. a registered user can write commens on posts
6. an admin can turn registered users into admins 
7. an admin can create new blog posts
8. blog posts have a headline and a main text
9. a registered user can delete their own comments
10. an admin can delete any comment
11. an admin can edit blog posts
12. an admin can delete a blog post and their comments
13. a user can see the history of edits made on a blog post
